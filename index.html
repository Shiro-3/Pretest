                        <p>Honkai: Star Rail is a turn-based RPG very similar to old-school JRPGs (especially the Final Fantasy series).
                        The game is split into two modes: overworld and battle. In the overworld, you run around the map and when you encounter an enemy group,
                        you will 'transfer' into the battle mode where you have to defeat the enemies in turn-based combat.Each Character in Honkai: Star Rail also has a Path as well.
                        You can think of Paths as character classes. A Character's Path will give you a general idea of what role that
                        Character fulfills in combat as well as what Light Cones they can fully utilize.<br><br>
                        <b>There are currently 7 Paths in the game:</b>

                        <p>For Japanese fans, especially in the mobile game realm, you will definitely be familiar with the Arknights game,
                        which is predicted to be on par with other popular games such as Fate Grand Order, Granblue Fantasy, and Azur Lane.
                        For this reason, the KotGa Crew was curious and wanted to try out how interesting the game made by Yostar was,
                        which is the same developer as Azur Lane. Without further ado, let's start discussing this game which was just
                        released globally on January 16!.<br><br>
